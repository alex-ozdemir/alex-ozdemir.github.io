![A picture of me][portrait]

I'm a future grad student looking to investigate computation as a medium for
**machine instruction** and **human expression**. I have broad interests, love
learning, and love teaching.

I'm finishing my bachelor's degree at Harvey Mudd, where I've been studying
Computer Science, Math, and Physics. While here I've worked on projects in
Computational Biology, Data Structures, Program Analysis, Digital Design, and
Linguistic Theory. I've also been involved in the institution in various
extra-curricular capacities, such as teaching my own class, interviewing
prospective students, and serving as the Judiciary Chair of the college's Honor
Code.

I spent my summers at J.P. Morgan (building automation tools), Facebook
(protyping a 10GB/s data pipeline), Harvard (doing program analysis on unsafe
Rust), and I'll be spending the next one at Coursera.

In the Fall of 2018 I'll begin my Phd. in Computer Science at Stanford.
