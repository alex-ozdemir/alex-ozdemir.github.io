![A picture of me](/images/portrait-photo.jpg){: .img-medium .align-center}

I'm a Phd. student at Stanford investigating computation as a medium for
**machine instruction** and **human expression**. I enjoy writing proofs and
building computer systems, sometimes [simultaneously][cvc4]. I have broad
interests, love learning, and love teaching.

Before graduate school I taught computer science and math for a year at a
[small boarding school][loomis] in Connecticut. I suspect I was too hard on my
computer science students and not hard enough on my math students.

I did my undergrad at [Harvey Mudd][hmc], where I studied [Computer Science,
Math, and Physics][ips]. I learned alot there, and I believe deeply in the
ideals that the school aspires to.

I grew up in Sacramento, California.
